Turn the current uncommitted work into a sequence of self-contained conventional commits, ordered so every commit builds on the one before it.

**Input**: Optionally a subset of paths, a requested grouping, or a scope. Without one, the scope is everything uncommitted — staged, unstaged, and untracked.

**Steps**

1. **Survey the worktree**

   Run and read all of:
   - `git status --short` — staged, unstaged, untracked
   - `git diff --stat` and `git diff` — unstaged content
   - `git diff --cached` — already-staged content
   - `git log --oneline -15` — the message style this repo actually uses
   - `git check-ignore -v <path>` — separate intentional content from ignored output. This repo deliberately un-ignores the eval corpus (see step 6), so never infer "ignored" from a filename alone.

   Read enough of every changed file to know *what it does*, not just which directory it sits in. Never group by filename alone: a single file often carries two concerns, and two files often carry one.

2. **Group into concerns**

   Each group is one concern that stands alone and reads coherently on its own. Name every group by the message you intend to write for it before touching the index.

   - A module's tests ride with the code they test (`tests/unit/test_<module>.py` with `src/numenews/<pkg>/`). A separate `test(<scope>)` commit is for standalone test infrastructure only (`tests/conftest.py`, shared fixtures).
   - Config settings ride with the feature that consumes them; a Pydantic model that crosses a boundary rides with the tool or command that returns it.
   - Docs describing changed behavior ride with the change; substantial prose becomes its own `docs(<scope>)` commit.
   - OpenSpec artifacts follow repo precedent: the change plan first, then the spec delta with the code, and the task tick-off in the same commit as the work it completes — `AGENTS.md` pins one atomic task per `tasks.md` item.
   - Formatting-only churn in files unrelated to a change is never mixed into it — leave it out, or ask (step 8). A repo-wide `make format` pass produces exactly this churn.

3. **Order foundational to dependent**

   Dependencies point forward: no commit may need content that only lands in a later one. The repo's ladder:

   openspec plan → `config` / `logging` → `models` → `numerology` (pure domain) → `news` + `embeddings` (adapters) → `vector` (Qdrant storage) → `agents` (`pydantic-ai`) → `pipeline` → `mcp` surface (the nine tools) → `cli` surface (the six commands) → docs → task tick-offs.

   The `numerology` package must not import `news`, `vector`, `agents`, or `mcp`; a commit that would require that import is on the wrong rung. Not every change uses every rung; preserve the relative order of the rungs it does use.

4. **Write the messages**

   `type(scope): summary`, e.g. `feat(mcp): expose the pattern search as a ninth tool`.

   - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build` are in use here; `refactor`, `perf`, `ci` are allowed when none of those fit.
   - **Scopes**: pick from the ones in use — `numerology`, `models`, `news`, `embeddings`, `vector`, `agents` (`src/numenews/agents/`), `pipeline`, `mcp`, `cli`, `config`, `logging`, `memory`, `eval`, `extraction`, `integration`, `docs`, `adr`, `openspec`, `deps` (`uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`), `infra` (Makefile, `docker-compose.yml`), `repo` (repo-wide chores). Fall back to the package directory name; do not invent a new scope without a reason. Note that `agents` is overloaded: it names both `src/numenews/agents/` and `.agents/skills/`, so spell the skill definitions `skills` in the subject when the distinction matters (`chore(agents)` in `9d2a5a9` is the one precedent for the skills).
   - Imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period, subject at most 72 characters.
   - **No body.** The subject is the whole message: this repo's commits do not carry explanatory prose, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` states the rule. Write a body only when the user explicitly asks for one, wrapped at 72.
   - No `Co-Authored-By` or "Generated with" trailers unless the user asks for them — this repo's history has none.

5. **Stage explicitly**

   Stage one group at a time with explicit paths: `git add -- <path>…`.

   When one file's hunks belong to different groups, split them: `git add -p` when the session is interactive, otherwise build a filtered patch and `git apply --cached <patch>`. Confirm what is actually staged with `git diff --cached --stat` and `git status --short` before committing.

   Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git add -f`, or `git commit -a`. Committing is not editing: never modify tracked content to force a clean split. If a file genuinely mixes unrelated concerns, that is an ambiguity — ask (step 8).

6. **Run the safety gate before every commit**

   Read the full staged diff — not just the stat — then check:

   - **Secrets**: news-source API keys (GDELT, NewsAPI, GNews, Mediastack, Currents) live in `.env`, which is gitignored; only `.env.example` is committed and holds placeholders. Never stage `.env`, and never stage a credential to "fix it later". Also watch `*.key`, `*.pem`, and `.cache/` — the hishel (RFC 9111) response cache can hold credentials echoed back in response bodies.
   - **Ignored and build output**: never force-add what `.gitignore` covers — `.venv/`, `.venv-eval/`, `.cache/` (hishel plus the fastembed model blobs), `.qdrant/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `*.hishel`, `htmlcov/`, `coverage.xml`, `docs/coverage.html`, `.docs/` (the private design brief). The deliberate exception: `.gitignore` ignores `*.jsonl` but un-ignores `tests/fixtures/**/*.jsonl` and `tests/eval/fixtures/**/*.jsonl`. The eval corpus is committed on purpose and pins its own size (ADR 0013) — do not "clean it up".
   - **Generated files**: `docs/eval_report.md` is produced from string literals in `tests/eval/test_rag.py`, and `docs/coverage_report.md` records the floors enforced by `make coverage-check`. Regenerate them (`make test-eval`, `make test`) and edit the generator in the same commit — never hand-edit a report alone, because the next run silently reverts it.
   - **Build**: the gate is `make lint` (ruff check, ruff format --check, `mypy --strict`) and `make test` (unit + integration with coverage, then the per-layer floors: numerology ≥95, agents + pipeline ≥80, vector + news ≥70). For a change's spec delta also run `openspec validate "<name>" --strict`, and `openspec validate --specs` when main specs were touched. `make format` rewrites files in place — re-check `git status` afterwards and put each resulting edit in the commit it belongs to, or ask. Never commit a tree the commit itself breaks.
   - **Hooks**: never `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the cause and re-stage.

7. **Commit and confirm the sequence**

   Commit each group with its message (`git commit -m "<subject>"`, plus `-m "<body>"` when there is one), then re-run `git status --short` before starting the next group. Never `--amend` unless the user asks for it, and never amend a commit that may be pushed — check `git branch -r --contains <sha>` first.

8. **Stop and ask when a grouping is ambiguous**

   Ask — with the concrete candidates, the exact paths or hunks each would take, and a recommended option — when:

   - a file's hunks mix unrelated concerns and cannot be split without editing it;
   - a change plausibly belongs to two groups, or its tests/docs could accompany either of two commits;
   - formatting-only churn lands in files unrelated to the change;
   - a file's intent is genuinely unclear, or work is already partly committed so an amend would be needed;
   - credential-looking content appears in the diff — never rewrite history to remove an already-committed secret, stop and report it;
   - OpenSpec task tick-offs disagree with the code actually present;
   - the user's requested grouping conflicts with a dependency order.

   Otherwise proceed: the instruction is to ask on ambiguity, not to gate every commit.

9. **Verify and report**

   After the last commit, check the result:

   - `git log --oneline <original-head>..HEAD` — the commits, in order
   - `git status --short` — only intentionally-left changes remain

   Report each commit with its hash, message, and files/hunks; what was intentionally left uncommitted and why; anything the safety gate skipped; and any commit that did not come out self-contained.

**Guardrails**

- Never push, create or delete branches, rebase, reset, or drop stashes.
- Never rewrite history — not even to remove a secret; stop and report instead.
- Never commit unless committing is what was asked for.
- In plan mode, present the grouping plan for approval instead of committing.
- Grouping is a judgment call about the user's intent: when the diff does not settle it, ask rather than guess.
